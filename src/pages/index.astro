/**
 * Home Page - Rio Attractions Interactive Map
 *
 * This is the main entry point for the application.
 * It's an Astro page that renders our React App component.
 *
 * Astro Page Structure:
 * - The frontmatter (between ---) runs on the server at build time
 * - The template below is the HTML that gets rendered
 * - React components with client directives are hydrated on the client
 *
 * Hydration Strategies:
 * - client:load - Hydrate immediately when page loads
 * - client:idle - Hydrate when browser is idle
 * - client:visible - Hydrate when component is visible
 * - client:media - Hydrate at specific media query
 * - client:only - Never SSR, only client-side
 *
 * For our interactive map app, we use client:load because:
 * 1. The map needs to be interactive immediately
 * 2. Users expect to interact with it right away
 * 3. There's no meaningful static version to show

    React App Component

    client:load hydration strategy ensures the app is interactive
    as soon as possible after page load.

    Why client:load instead of client:idle?
    - Users expect to interact with the map immediately
    - The map is the main content, not secondary
    - Better perceived performance for first interaction
